# A-Search
Basic implementation of A* graph searching algorithm  
  
After makefile the project can be run by ./project5 [inputfile] [outputfile]   
  
First line contains V and E; two integers that represent the number of edges and vertices.  
Next V lines is the heuristic function.  
Next E lines contain 3 integers; The id of vertices and distance between them.  
Last line has the source and the target.
